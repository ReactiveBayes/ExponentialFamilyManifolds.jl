`ExponentialFamilyManifolds.jl` provides implementations of manifolds for the natural parameters of exponential family distributions, using `Manifolds.jl`. These manifolds are compatible with `ManifoldsBase.jl`, enabling optimization of the natural parameters of exponential family distributions using `Manopt.jl`.

Refer to the documentation for more information and optimization examples.
